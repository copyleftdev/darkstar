          THE "DON'T BE A DICK" PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

 1. Do whatever you want with the original work, essentially.
    Copy it, modify it, share it, print it out and wear it as a hat.
    It's yours.

 2. The Golden Rule: Don't be a dick.

    "Being a dick" includes, but is not limited to:
    * Using this software to hurt people, effectively or affectively.
    * Taking credit for work you didn't do.
    * Wrapping this code in DRM and selling it for a subscription fee.
    * Using this code to mine crypto on grandma's computer without consent.
    * Filing frivolous lawsuits.

 3. If you break Rule #2, you lose the right to use Rule #1.
    You also have to buy the original author a beer (or coffee) 
    if you ever meet them in person, and admit you were being a dick.

 4. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER:
    This software is provided "as is". If it breaks your computer,
    burns down your house, or insults your cat, the authors are
    not liable. We wrote this for fun, not to guarantee 
    mission-critical stability for your nuclear power plant.
    Please use common sense.
